Perfectly formulated for the control of grease and dark grout lines in tile and stone floors. Enzymes penetrate semi-porous grout and stone and literally eat away at grease and oils trapped inside. Use daily as part of a complete maintenance program.

## Directions for use
Dispense solution from Acculogic dispenser directly into mop bucket. Mop solution onto floor to be cleaned in a figure 8 motion, making sure to cover the floor evenly with little excess liquid. Squeegee away any excess liquid and allow the floor to air dry. Do not rinse floor.
